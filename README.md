Welcome to the README file for my wordpress project!

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

In this project, i have implemented a Rating System for articles in WordPress. The Rating System allows users to give a rating to articles based on their level of enjoyment or usefulness. The rating is displayed on the article page for other users to see.

HOW TO USE

to use this project u can put the contents of the "functions-rate-system.php" in your "functions.php" file.
then u can use the "rate-form.php" contents in your theme. for example in your "single.php" file. for last steps u can use asset files in your theme to have this future in your theme.

GOOD LUCK
